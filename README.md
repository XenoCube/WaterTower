Simple Water Machine 
Specs:
  1. RO Filter - To remove most of the impurities.
  2. Pressure Tank - To reduce duty cycle on the pump.
  3. UV Filter - To sterilize the water of any biological pathogens.
  4. Carbon Filter - Mostly for taste.

I built this project as I was looking for a water purification machine but what I found was either cheap with high price replacement filters or expensive with filters that had short life spans.
This was printed with a larger format machines (300x300 base plate) using PETG filament. (Xenocube and Ender 3 Max)
STL files have uploaded, if interested in printing, all but the tray can be printed without supports.
BOM contains a list of all the parts sourced through Amazon with links.
